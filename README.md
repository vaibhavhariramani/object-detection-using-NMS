# object-detection using NMS
Object Detector using NMS. | [Video](https://youtu.be/Ykmi1wlGILE)

## Run the code

I have created a single python script that can be used to test the code. To test the code, run the lines below in your terminal.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bikz05/object-detector.git
cd object-detector/bin
test-object-detector
```

_The `test-object-detector` will download the [UIUC Image Database for Car Detection](https://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/Data/Car/) and train a classifier to detect cars in an image. The SVM model files will be stored in `data/models`, so that they can be resused later on._

### Configuration File

All the configurations are in the `data/config/config.cfg` configuration files. You can change it as per your need. Here is what the default configuration file looks like (which I have set for Car Detector)-

```bash
[hog]
min_wdw_sz: [100, 40]
step_size: [10, 10]
orientations: 9
pixels_per_cell: [8, 8]
cells_per_block: [3, 3]
visualize: False
normalize: True

[nms]
threshold: .3

[paths]
pos_feat_ph: ../data/features/pos
neg_feat_ph: ../data/features/neg
model_path: ../data/models/svm.model
```

### About the modules

* `extract-features.py` -- This module is used to extract HOG features of the training images.
* `train-classifier.py` -- This module is used to train the classifier.
* `nms.py` -- This module performs Non Maxima Suppression.
* `test-classifier.py` -- This module is used to test the classifier using a test image.
* `config.py` -- Imports the configuration variables from `config.cfg`.

## Some of the results

## TODO

Here is list of tasks that I am planning to implement in the future -

* Optimize code to use more `numpy` vectorized codes.
* Faster NMS code.
* Add bootstrapping (Hard Negative Mining) code.

#### About me

I’ve always been the kind of developer who learns by building.
What started with IoT, Android, machine learning, and computer vision gradually turned into a career around cloud infrastructure, DevOps, SRE, distributed systems, and AI.
Today I spend most of my time designing and automating cloud systems, working with Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, Azure, CI/CD, observability, and Python — but I still make time for the kind of projects that started everything: building random ideas just to see if I can.
I’ve worked at Jaguar Land Rover, Avaya, 42Gears, and OneWorld, and completed my MSc in Computer Science at University College Dublin.
Some repositories here are polished projects. Others are experiments, old ideas, or things I built simply because I was curious.
That’s probably the best description of me as a developer: curious enough to build it, and stubborn enough to figure out how it works.
